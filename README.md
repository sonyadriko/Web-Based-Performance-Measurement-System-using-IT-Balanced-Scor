<h2>Background</h2>
Performance measurement is crucial for the effective management of information systems in any organization. The IT Balanced Scorecard (IT BSC) is a strategic management tool that extends the traditional Balanced Scorecard approach to the IT domain. It evaluates performance based on four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning & growth.
